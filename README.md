Tom Holroyd’s
[patsolve](http://cards.wikia.com/wiki/Patsolve),
an automated solver for [Freecell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeCell) and some
related versions of Patience (or card Solitaire). It is in the process
of being integrated into [Freecell Solver](http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/)
which is another solver.
